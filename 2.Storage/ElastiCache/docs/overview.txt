ElastiCache:
    -Is to get managed Redis or Memcached
    -Caches are in-memory databases with really high performance, low latency
    -Helps reduce load off of databases for read intensive workloads
    -Helps make your application stateless
    -Write Scaling using sharding
    -Read Scaling using Read Replicas
    -Multi AZ with Failover Capability
    -AWS takes care of configurations

Redis:
    -In-memory key-value store
    -Super low latency
    -Cache survive reboots by default
    -Gread to host:
        -User sessions
        -Leaderboard (gaming)
        -Distributed states
        -Pub /sub messaging
    -Multi AZ with automatic failover recovery

Memcached:
    -in-memory object store
    -Cache doesn't survive reboots
    -Use cases:
        -Quick retrieval of objects from memory
        -Cache often accessed objects
    -Is less used than Redis.
