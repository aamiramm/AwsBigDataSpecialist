Write Capacity Units:
    -One write capacity unit represents one write per second for an item up to 1 KB in size (1-1/s)
    -If the items are larger than 1 KB, more WCU are consumed
    
    -Example 1: we write 10 objects persecond of 2 KB each
        -> 2*10 = 20 WCU
    -Example 2: we write 6 objects per second of 4.5 KB each
        -> 6*5 = 30 WCU (4.5 gets rounded to the upper KB)
    -Example 3: we write 120 objects per minute of 2KB each
        -> 120/60 * 2 = 4 WCU
