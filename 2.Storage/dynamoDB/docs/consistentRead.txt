Strongly Consistent Read vs Eventually Consistent Read:
    -Eventually:
        -> if we read just after a write, it's possible we'll get unexpected response
            because of replication
    -Consistent:
        -> If we read just after a write, we will get the correct data

    Default:
        -> DynamoDB uses Eventually Consistent Reads but GetItem, Query & Scan
            provide a "ConsistentRead" parameter you can set to True
