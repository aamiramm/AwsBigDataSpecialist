Provisioned service:
    -Table must have privisioned read and write capacity units
    -Read Capacity Units (RCU): throughput for reads
    -Write Capacity units (WCU): throughput for writes
    -Option to setup auto-scaling of throughput to meet demand
    -throughput can be exceeded temporarily using "burst credit"
    -If burst credit are empty, you'll get a "ProvisionedThroughputException".
    -It's then advised to do an exponential back-off retry
    

Throttling:
    -If we exceed our RCU or WCU, we get "ProvisionedThroughputExceptions"
    -Reasons:
        -Hot keys / partitions: one partition key is beign read too many times
         (popular item for example)
        -Very large items: RCU and WCU depends on size of items
    -Solutions:
        -Exponential back-off when exception is encountered
        -Distribute partition keys as much as possible
        -If RCU issue, we can use DybamoDB Accelerator (DAX)
