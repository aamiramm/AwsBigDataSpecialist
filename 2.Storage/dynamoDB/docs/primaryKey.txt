Each table must have a primary key:
    -Option 1: Partition key only (HASH)
        -Partition key must be unique for each item
        -Must be diverse
        -example: user_id for all users in a table
    -Option 2: Partition key + Sort Key
        -Combination must be unique
        -Data is grouped by partition key
        -Sort key == range key
        -Example: users-games table
                -user_id partition and game_id for sort key

Exercise:
    -Movie database:
        -best partition key to maximize data distribution?
            -movie_id
            -producer_name
            -leader_actor_name
            -movie_language

    ---> You must select the key which have the highest cardinality (most unique values)
    ---> So the best choice in this case is movie_id
    ---> a field like movie_language can have so few values, so it's not a good partition key
