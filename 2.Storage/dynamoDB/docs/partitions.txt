DynamoDB - Partitions Internal
    -Yoy start with one partition
    -Each partition:
        -Max of 3000 RCU / 1000 WCU
        -Max of 10 GB
    -TO compute the number of partitions:
        -By capacity:
            -> (TOTAL RCU/3000) + (TOTAL WCU/1000)
        -By size:
            -> TOTAL SIZE/10 GB
        -Total Partitions:
            -> CEILING(MAX(Capacity, Size))
        
    -WCU and RCU are spread evenly between partitions
