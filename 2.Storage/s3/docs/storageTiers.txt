Storage Tiers:
    -Important to be the most cost efficient
    -Tiers:
        -Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose:
            -High durability (99.9*9 %) of objects across multiple AZ
            -If store 10 million objects with S3, can on average expect
             to incur a loss of a single object once every 10.000 years
            -99.99% Availability over a given year
            -Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures, save a backup storage to retrieve
             data if failures
            -Use cases: Big Data Analytics, mobile & gaming apps, content distribution

        -Amazon S3 Standard - Infrequent Access (IA):
            -Suitable for data that is less frequently accessed, but require
             rapid access when needed
            -Is cheaper if really is less accessed, but it cost an ammount for
             each time is accessed
            -High durability (99.9*9 %) across multiple AZ
            -99.9% Availability
            -Low cost compared to Standard
            -Use cases: Something like monthly accessed data and mid term backups

        -Amazon S3 One Zone -Infrequent Access:
            -Even cheaper than IA (by 20%), store data in a single AZ
            -high durability (99.9*9 %), but data lost when AZ is destroyed
            -99.95% availability
            -Low latency and high throughput performance
            -Support SSL for data at transit and encryption at rest
            -Use cases: Storing secondary backup copies of on-premise data, or
                store data that you can recreate

        -Amazon S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage (deprecated):
            -99.99% durability
            -99.99% availability
            -Sustain the loss of data in a single facility
            -Use cases: noncritical, reproducible data at lower levels of
             redundancy than Standard

        -Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering (new):
            -99.90% availability
            -Same low latency and performance of Standard
            -small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
            -Automatically moves objects between two access tiers based on changing
             access patterns

        -Amazon Glacier:
            -Low cost object storage meant for archiving /backup
            -Data is retained for the longer term (10s of years)
            -Alternative to on-premise magnetic tape storage
            -cost per month ($0.004/GB) + retrieval cost
            -Each item in Glacier is called "Archive" (up to 40TB)
            -Archives stored in "Vaults"
            -3 retrieval options:
                -Expediated: (1 to 5 minutes retrieval) - $0.03 per GB and $0.01 per request
                -Standard: (3 to 5 hours) - $0.01 per GB and 0.05 per 1000 request
                -Bulk: (5 to 12 hours) - $0.0025 per GB and $0.025 per 1000 requests
