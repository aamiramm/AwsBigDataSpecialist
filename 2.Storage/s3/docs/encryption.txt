S3 Encryption:
    -Methods:
        -SSE-S3: Encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
            -Objects are encrypted server side
            -AES-256 encryption type
            -Must set header: "x-amz-server-side-encryption":"AES256"

        -SSE-KMS: Leverage AWS Key management service to manage encryption keys
            -KMS user control + audit trail
            -encryption server side
            -must set header: "x-amz-service-side-encryption":"aws:kms"

        -SSE-C When want to manage own envryption keys
            -Keys full managed by customer
            -S3 does not store encryption key
            -HTTPS must be used
            -Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made

        -Client Side Encryption
            -Amazon S3 Encryption Client
            -Clients must encrypt data themselve before sending to S3
            -Clients must decrypt data when retrieving from S3
            -Clients manage full keys and encryption cycle

    Encryption in transit (SSL)
        -AWS S3 exposes
            -HTTP : non encrypted
            -HTTPS encryption in flight
