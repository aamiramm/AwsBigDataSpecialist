Versioning:
    -Can be versioned the files in AWS S3
    -It's enabled at the bucket level
    -Same key overwrite will increment the version: 1,2,3...
    -It's best practice to version your buckets
        -protect againts unintended deletes
        -easy roll back to previous version
    -Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling will have version "null"
    -You can "suspend" versioning
