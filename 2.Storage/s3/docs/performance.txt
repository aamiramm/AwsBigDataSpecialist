S3 Performance:
    -When had > 100 TPS (transaction per second), s3 performance could degrade
    -Behind the scene, each object goes to an S3 partition and for the best performance
     we want the highest partition distribution (as many partitions as possible)
    -In the exam is recommended to have random characters in front of your key name
     to optimise performance:
        -<my_bucket>/534d_my_folder/my_file1.txt
        -<my_bucket>/a91e_my_folder/my_file2.txt


    -NEVER USE DATES TO PREFIX KEYS:
        -<my_bucket>/2020_06_24_my_folder/my_file1.txt

-If there's a loooot (more than 350 RPS for PUT or 5500 RPS for get for EACH PREFIX)
    is RECOMMENDED TO RANDOMIZE PREFIX KEY NAMES

-Faster upload of large objects(>5GB), use multipart upload:
    -Parallelizes PUTs for greather throughput
    -maximize your network bandwidth
    -decrease time to retry in case a part fails

-Use CloudFront to cache S3 objects around the world (improves reads)
-S3 transfer acceleration  (uses edge locatoins) -- just need to change the 
    endpoint you write to
-If use SSE-KMS encryption, you may be limited (~100s - 1000s downloads/uploads per second)
