S3:
    -Allows people to store objects in "buckets"
    -Bucket must have a globally unique name
    -Buckets are defined at the region level

Objects(files)
    -Hace a key (the key is the FULL path)
    -there's no concept of "directories" within buckets
    -Just keys with very long names that contain "/"
    -Object Values are the content of the body:
        -Max size is 5 TB
        -If uploading more than 5GB, must be "multi-part upload"
    -Metadata as a part of objects (list of text key/ value pairs)
    -Tags: useful for security /lifecycle
    -Version ID: s3 allows versioning of the objects if is enabled

Consistency Model:
    -Special when used with EMR
    -Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
        -As soon an object is written, we can retrieve it
    
    Eventual consistency for DELETES and PUTS of existing objects
        -If we read an object after updating, we might get the older version
        -If we delete an object, we might still be able to retrieve it for a short time
