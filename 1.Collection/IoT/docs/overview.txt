Internet of Things:
    -The objects are "Things"
    -The IoT Thing comunicate with the another with a Device Gateway
    -The Device Gateway send the messages to a IoT Message Broker
        -The Device Gateway can establish some Rules Engine to modify the messages or
            control it
        -Device Gateway can establish some rules actions to sent message to different targets:
            -Kinesis
            -SQS
            -Lambda
            -etc
    -Can be also integrated with Device Shadow:
        -Can change states from the messages and resend messages to the thing
        -If the original thing is disconnected, the device shadow save his state after changes
            And when the thing is "ON", the device shadow restore his state
