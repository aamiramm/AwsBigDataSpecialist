Streams:
    -Going to write custom code (producer /consumer)
    -Real time (~200 ms latency for classic, ~70 ms latency for enhanced fan-out)
    -Must manage scaling manually
    -Data storage for 1 to 7 days, replay capability, multiple consumers
    -Use with lambda to insert data in real-time to ElasticSearch

Firehose:
    -Full managed, send to S3, Splunk, Redshift, ElasticSearch
    -Serverless data transformations with Lambda
    -Near real time (lowest buffer time is 1 minute)
    -Automated Scaling
    -No data storage
