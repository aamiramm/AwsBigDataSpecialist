Kinesos Operations
    -Adding Shards
        -Also called "Shard Splitting"
        -Can be used to increase the stream capacity (1mb/s data per shard)
        -Can be used to divide a "hot shard"
        -The old shard is closed and will be deleted the data is expired
            -A shard will split in two or more and the new ones will use the old place
        
    -Merging Shards
        -Decrease the Stream capacity and save costs
        -Group two shards with low traffic
        -Old shards are closed and deleted based on data expiration

    -Auto Scaling
        -Is not a native feature in Kinesis
        -We can implement Auto Scaling using AWS Lambda

    -Limitations-
        -Resharding cannot be done in parallel
        -Only 1 resharding operation at a time and take a few seconds
        -For 1000 shards it takes 30 000 seconds (8.3 hours) to double the shards to 2000

        -Can't do the following:
            -Scale more than twice for each rolling 24-hour period for each stream
            -Scale up to more than double your current shard count for a stream
            -Scale down below half your current shard count for a stream
            -Scale up to more than 500 shards in a stream
            -Scale a stream with more than 500 shards down unless the result is fewer than 500 shards
            -Scale up to more than the shard limit for your account
