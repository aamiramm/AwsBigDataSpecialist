Kinesis Streams:
    -Are divided in ordered shard  --> Shard is the equivalent for the partition
    --->Producers --> Shards ---> consumers
    -Data retention is 24 hours by default, can go up to 7 days
    -Ability to reprocess / replay data during the data retention period
    -Multiple applications can consume the same Streams
    -Real-time processing
    -Once data is inserted in Kinesis, can't be deleted (immutability)

Kinesis Stream Shards:
    -One stream is made of many shards
    -Billing is per shard
    -Number of shards can evolve over time (reshard /merge)
    -Records are orderer per shard
    -Shards produces data as records in the form of Data Blobs

Kinesis Stream Records:
    -Data Blob:
        -Data being sent, serialized as Bytes (Up to 1 MB) can represent anything 
    -Record Key:
        -Help to find shard to send data to
        -Sent alongside a record, help to group records in Shards. Same key = Same shard.
        -Use highly distributed key to avoid the "hot partition" problem

    -Sequence number: 
        -Unique identifier for each record put in shards. Added by kinesis after ingestion

Kinesis Stream Limits:
    -Producer:
        -Can produce max 1 MB/s or 1000 messages/s at write PER SHARD
    -Consumer classic:
        -2 MB at read PER SHARD across all consumers
        -5 API calls per second PER SHARD across all consumers
    -Consumer Enhanced Fan-Out:
        -2 MB at read PER SHARD, PER ENHANCED CONSUMER
        -No API calls needed (push model)

    -Data Retention:
        -24 hours by default, up to 7 days max
