Kinesis:
    -Managed alternative to Apache Kafka for rea-time big data
    -Great for logs, metrics, IoT, clickstreams
    -Great for streaming processing frameworks (Spark, NiFi, etc...)
    -Data is automatically replicated to 3AZ
    -Types:
        -Kinesis Streams:
            -Low latency streaming ingest at scale
        -Kinesis Analytics:
            -Perform real-time analytics using SQL
        -Kinesis Firehose:
            -Load streams into S3, Redshift, ElasticSearch & Splunk --> for data loads
        
Architecture:
    -Amazon kinesis streams receives all the data, the click streams, IoT Services, Metrics & logs
    -Kinesis streams optionally move the data forward Amazon Kinesis Analytics 
        to analyze and extract some real-time metrics 
    -The data comes to Amazon Kinesis Firehose which is near-real time
