Kinesis Data Stream:
    -Data can be consumed many times
    -Data is deleted after the retention period (1-7 days)
    -Ordering of records is preserved (at the shard level)
    -Build multiple applications reading from the same stream
    -Streaming MapReduce querying capability
    -Checkpointing needed to track progress of consumption
    -Shards must be provided ahead of time ( must be specified manually)

When use Kinesis Data Stream:
    Fast log and event data collection and processing
    -Real Time metrics and reports
    -Mobile data capture
    -Real Time data analytics
    -Gaming data feed
    -Complex Stream Processing
    -Data Feed from Internet of Things

SQS:
    -Queue, decouple applications
    -One application per queue
    -Records are deleted after consumption
    -Messages are processed independly for standard queue
    -Ordering for FIFO queues
    -Capability to "delay" messages
    -Dynamic scaling of load

When use SQS:
    -Order processing
    -Image processing
    -Auto scaling queues according to messages
    -Buffer and batch messages for future processing
    -Request offloading
