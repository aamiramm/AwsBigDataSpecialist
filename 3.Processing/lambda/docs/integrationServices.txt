Integration with elastic search:
    -Can process data during the travel
    ->object creation can trigger a lambda function and take it to Amazon elastic search
    ->Elastic search will take the metrics, can analyze clickstreams, real-time data, start the service itself

Integration with Data Pipeline:
    ->Can also be triggered from s3, and lambda will trigger an AWS Data Pipeline that
        will process the data further
    ->Can "fix" the scheduler process of a data pipeline

Integration with Redshift 
    -> Lambda allows to upload data into redshift database
    -> A problem is that lambda can't have any state information so can't pass any information from
        a lambda to another, so is useful to save the batching data into a service like DynamoDB
        and recover his state in the next lambda run
    -> Lambda can run a copy command from redshift

Integration with Kinesis:
    ->Lambda receives an event with a batch of stream records
        -The trigger can be setted up will the batch size (up to 10,000 records)
        -Must be define correctly the timeout depending of batch size, default (900 seconds)

        ->Lambda will retry the same batch until it succeeds or data expires
