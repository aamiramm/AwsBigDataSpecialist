What is?:
    -A way to run code snippets "in the cloud"
    -Used to process data as it's moved around
    -Don't have to worry about a server to run into
    -Automatically scale up the hardware to run the data is coming in


Why not just run a server?:
    -Server management (patches, monitoring, hardware failures)
    -Servers can be cheap, but scaling gets expensive really fast
    -You don't pay for processing time, you don't use
    -Easier to split up development between front-end and back-end

Main uses:
    -Real-time file processing
    -Real-time stream processing
    -ETL
    -Cron replacement
    -Process AWS events --> any service that can generate triggers to lambda

Extra:
    -High availability
    -unlimited scalability
    -High performance
        -But you do specify a timeout
        -This can cause problems, max is 900 seconds
